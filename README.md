# Hyderabad-Metro-Train-Project
Hyderabad metro contains a total of 55 Stations including the Green line metro along with the Red and blue lines.
The project is created using Dijikstra Algorithm to know the shortest distances from a Source Station to all other remaining Stations.
In this case the distancre between two successive Stations are assumed to be 1 unit.
Thus, this project more shows the less number of Stations between a Source Station to all other remaining Stations.
Time Complexity for this Program is O(V).
where V is the number of vertices(i.e., Stations).
Space Complexity is O(V*V).
